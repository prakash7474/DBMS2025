The overall code idea for the Campus Event Management System (CEMS) involves organizing the codebase into modular layers for data management, business logic, and user interaction. The system uses ReactJS for the front-end, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database, all communicating via RESTful APIs.

Code Architecture
Front-End (ReactJS):

Pages/Views: Login, Dashboard, Clubs List, Club Details, Event List, Event Details, Registration, Feedback, Profile

Components: Navbar, ClubCard, EventCard, RegistrationForm, FeedbackForm, Announcements

API Calls: Use Axios or Fetch to interact with backend endpoints for CRUD operations

Back-End (Node.js):

REST API Endpoints:

/auth/login and /auth/register for student authentication via college email

/clubs for club browsing (GET), joining (POST)

/events for viewing, registering, and managing events

/announcements for posting and viewing club updates

/feedback for event feedback submission and retrieval

Business Logic: Validation of registration, event participation, permissions for club heads and members

Authentication: JWT or session-based for secure access

Database (PostgreSQL):

Tables:

Department, Club, ClubUser (Head), Student, Event, Venue, EventType, Registration, Certificate, Announcement, Feedback

Relationships managed through foreign keys as detailed in the ER diagram and relational schema

Major Modules and Ideas
Authentication Module: Secure signup and login, only college emails permitted

Clubs Module: Fetch and display list of clubs, join/leave club actions, fetch club details and announcements

Events Module: Show all events, register for events, display event details, manage events (for club heads)

Feedback Module: Students submit feedback after event participation, view previous feedback

Admin/Club Head Module: Dashboard for event, member, and announcement management; permission checks for restricted access

Announcements Module: CRUD operations on club announcements for authorized users

This modular approach ensures easy scalability and separation of concerns, while each function matches the requirements for students, club members, and heads.

The UI reference for the Campus Event Management System (CEMS) focuses on delivering a clear, intuitive experience tailored to both students and club administrators. The design includes distinct pages and dynamic components, each serving a specific part of the event and club management workflow.

Main Screen Layouts
Login/Register Page: Allows students to sign in or register using their college email credentials. Input fields for email and password, with validation and user feedback.

Dashboard: After login, users see a dashboard that summarizes their joined clubs, registered events, and recent announcements.

Clubs List Page: Displays all available college clubs in card view, each showing club name, description, and a "Join" or "View" button.

Club Details Page: On clicking a club, a page shows its description, list of upcoming events, announcements, and "Join Club" if not already a member.

Event List and Details: Shows all events in a list or card view. Each event card includes name, date, venue, event type, club name, and a "Register" button if registration is open.

Registration & Feedback: Forms for registering to events and submitting feedback, with simple success/error message handling.

Announcements: Dedicated section for announcements from clubs, viewable for all; posting allowed for authorized club heads.

Core UI Components
Navigation Bar: Top/bottom navigation bar for easy movement between Dashboard, Clubs, Events, Announcements, and Profile.

Cards: Reusable card components for clubs and events, improving readability and quick interactions.

Forms: Consistent input forms for login, event registration, and feedback, ensuring error-free and guided entries.

Tables/Lists: For event participants, feedback summaries, and club members (admin view).

Clean & Minimal: Focus on relevant content with minimal distractions, prioritizing event and club discovery.

This UI reference ensures students can easily browse, join, and register, while club heads get the tools to manage events and engage members efficiently.
